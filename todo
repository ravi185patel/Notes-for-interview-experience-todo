Important logic interview questions
1] 
Integer in=10,out=10
in==out is false or true ?
Integer in=1000,out=10000
in==out is false or true ?

2] what happen when only equals method override in class which can be use as key
same when only hashcode overridde ?
when both are not override ?

3] why no which is used to multiply/divided  hashcode should be prime ?

4] if hashcode and equals method not override 
hashmap.put<new Employee(1,"xyz"),1);
hashmap.put<new Employee(1,"xyz"),2);
what will be size of hashmap ?

5] How hashset work ?(internal working)

6] what is syntax of euqals and hashcode method ?


===========================================
//java questions
Abstract vs encapsulation vs interface.
Real life example where abstract or interface use.
Method overridiing vs overloading with example(real life).
Method overriding rules.
how method get hide in java.
Can i override implement method in parent with abstract method in child class.

---------------------------------------------------
what will be output
parent{

public void getName(String name){}
public void getName(Object name){}
}

getName(null) -> call which method ?
do we get any issue or it will execute fine ?
---------------------------------------------------

can i overload final method in java ?

what are marker interface in java and what is use of marker interface ?

------
create immutable class

why immutable class and it's properties are final ?
how to prevent immutability if immutable class have mutable object as refrence ?
how to prevent immutability if immutable class have list of mutable object as refrence ?
how to prevent immutability if immutable class have dependecy chain ?
how to prevent class to being clone if it had implement cloneable interface ?
Ex employee have address 


---------------------

final List<Sring> lst=new ArrayList<>();
lst.add("xyz"); -- is it work or not ?
why ?

final List<String> imm=Collections.unmodifiableList(lst);
imm.add("xyz");-- is it work ?
why ?



------------ Collections ------------

parent class of all collections ?

internal working of
HashSet,TreeMap,HashMap,ConcurrentHashMap,CopyOrArrayList

what happen when only equals method override in class which can be use as key
same when only hashcode overridde ?
when both are not override ?

why no which is used to multiply/divided  hashcode should be prime ?

if hashcode and equals method not override 
hashmap.put<new Employee(1,"xyz"),1);
hashmap.put<new Employee(1,"xyz"),2);
what will be size of hashmap ?

what is syntax of euqals and hashcode method ?


what will be the output?
lst.add(0,10);
lst.set(0,-1);


what is Failsafe and failfast ?

Thread safe collections
CopyOrWriteArraySet,CopyOrWriteArrayList,ConcurrentHashMap,SynchronizedList,SynchronizedSet,SynchronizedMap
Vectore,HashTable

what locking used in concurrentHashMap ?

Collections which are concurrent Modification safe.
CopyOrWriteArraySet,CopyOrWriteArrayList,ConcurrentHashMap


--------------------- 
what is executor framwork ?
how many and their internal working ?
How 


------------ patterns ---------
what is Solid Pattern ?
what patterns do you know and explain with life example or where it used in java?


write singleton class ?
why two looking required ?
what is half backed object in singleton ?
why Object is static and voletile ?
